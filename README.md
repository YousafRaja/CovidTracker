# CovidTracker

# What is this?
This little web app combines the Google Maps API with covid-19 tracking APIs to create a map that places markers on every US state. Upon clicking the marker, you'll see the current total number of positive cases in that state.  

# Design
I picked US states because they had enough API support. I needed an API that would return some useful information across all regions in one call.
I used the react framework from which I made the asynchronous API calls.

# How to run
- npm install
- npm run build
- npm start
