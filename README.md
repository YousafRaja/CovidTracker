# CovidTracker

# What it is this?
This is a little web app that you can run locally, it combines the Google Maps API with covid-19 tracking APIs to create a map that shows the total number of covid cases across US states. 

# Design
I picked US states because they had enough API support. I needed an API that would allow me to get some useful information across all regions in one call.
I used the react framework from which I made the asynchronous API calls. 

# How to run
npm install
npm run build
npm start
